# Data folder

Data goes in this directory. The scripts expect the subfolders to be called `training_dataset` and `validation_dataset`, but change scripts as you see fit. Each data folder contains two subfolders of `BM` and `FM`, which correspond to the bacterial and fungal mycetoma images respectively. Each image has a corresponding mask. For a given image/path pair, the image file is called `{name}.jpg` and the mask is called `{name}_mask.tif`.
